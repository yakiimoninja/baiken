The reticle's location is purely a visual cue for if it will hit or not, and will not perform any attack if the reticle is too far away.\nThe shot will hit if the reticle is within a circular area on the opponent's standing position, 100.1 units in radius.\nIf fired immediately upon readying the gun, there is a ~35% chance to hit a stationary opponent.\n* This chance is lowered to an ~8.8% chance if Chaos was airborne when readying the gun.\n* This chance is not improved by Curse or Focus.\nUpon firing, the reticle immediately resets, similar to At The Ready H. At fastest, the gun can be fired every 13 frames.\n* Conditions such as reticle movement, accuracy, and clean hits behave identically to when first using At The Ready.","hitboxCaption":"","images":"GGST_Happy_Chaos_H.png"}},{"title":{"input":"H","name":"At the Ready","damage":null,"guard":null,"startup":null,"active":null,"recovery":"Total 12","onHit":null,"onBlock":null,"level":null,"counter":null,"type":"special","riscGain":null,"riscLoss":null,"wallDamage":null,"inputTension":"0","chipRatio":null,"OTGType":null,"prorate":null,"invuln":null,"cancel":null,"caption":"''At The Ready''&lt\nbr&gt\nFor his neutral heavy, he wields a gun","notes":"Reticle appears on Frame 12 and Fire can be used from Frame 13 and onwards.\nDrains Concentration at 6% per second, or 3% per second if the Focus buff is active.\nFire and Cancel Aim inputs ''cannot'' be buffered at all during At The Ready's startup, and must be input Frame 13 or later.\nNo Counter Hit state, but does extend hurtbox momentarily.\nThe reticle will randomly appear in a square area 300×300 around the opponent's center.
